			<h2> New data from the Guttmacher Institute reveals overall increase in number of estimated abortions since the overturning of Roe v. Wade </h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022 — which eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion — abortions have been completely banned in 14 states (Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia), and have limitations in seven others (Utah, Arizona, Nebraska, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina). 
<br> Banning safe and legal abortions forces women to turn to other methods of terminating pregnancies, which are often self-managed and life-threatening. But in many cases — especially after the Dobbs v. Jackson decision — women will cross state lines to obtain abortions in states where they are still legal. </br>

			<h3>If more states are banning abortions, why are we seeing an increase?</h3>
			<img src="protest.png" alt="Photograph of abortion protest" height="250px" width="300px">
			<p>In an effort to track the total number of state and national abortion estimates per month, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2023/09/new-state-abortion-data-indicate-widespread-travel-care">the Guttmacher Institute</a> has collected data on procedural and medication abortions provided at clinics or doctor’s offices, as well as medication abortions provided via telehealth and virtual providers. They provide estimates from January to June of 2023 for each state that data is available (i.e. where abortion remains legal), and comparable data from 2020, which takes the total number of abortions from the entire year divided by two. 
According to the Guttmacher Institute, many states that are in close proximity to states that banned abortion saw much sharper increases in monthly abortion numbers than would likely be explained by a continuation of earlier trends — a direct result of women crossing state lines. <br> For example, South Carolina, which borders Georgia, saw a 124% increase in abortions from 2020 to 2023. </br>
Additionally, states that have enacted measures to protect and expand abortion access saw increases in abortion. This includes states such as Illinois, which saw a 69% increase in the number of abortions in 2023 compared to 2020. <br>Similarly, in Colorado (a state that has also enacted several measures protecting abortion), abortions increased by 89% between 2020 and 2023. </br>
Syracuse University political science professor Shana Gadarian contends that this is due to discrepancies between abortion rights and access, which she notes are two very different things. <br> 
“I would think about rights in terms of places where the abortion is being either codified in a constitution or it has been put into law as it is legal for everyone. So those are places like Michigan or Ohio or Kentucky, where we either have abortion being given as a right in the constitution or expansion of abortion,” Gadarian said. “There are more abortions being performed in certain states — and that’s because women are almost certainly crossing state lines to get abortions where they are still legal. And so it’s not that the overall number of abortions necessarily have gone down, it’s just that they’re being concentrated in places where it’s still legal.”</br>

			<h3>The implications of crossing state borders to obtain abortions</h3>
			<p>Traveling out-of-state to receive abortion care is a short-term solution to a long-term problem — and it is not without its challenges in regards to travel logistics, such as transportation, lodging and meals, and childcare arrangements.<br> According to the Guttmacher Institute, such challenges “are likely to increase as anti-abortion states escalate their attempts to interfere with out-of-state travel for abortion and as more states ban or severely restrict abortion, creating larger regional clusters of states with bans and thus increasing the likelihood that patients will have to cross multiple state lines to get care.” </br>
It is also important to note that for marginalized populations — for which high-quality and affordable healthcare is already severely limited — traveling out-of-state may not be an option. 
In the Guttmacher Institute’s <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2023/01/inequity-us-abortion-rights-and-access-end-roe-deepening-existing-divides">policy analysis</a> of inequities in US abortion rights and access, Liza Fuentes, a former senior research scientist at the Institute, notes that abortion restrictions and bans disproportionately affect Black, Latino, and Indigenous people and people living with low incomes, as well as transmen and nonbinary people, immigrants, adolescents, and those with disabilities. <br>
For example, Fuentes explained that in border states, immigrant communities are subject to immigration checkpoints, at which point they may be forced to travel to obtain care.</br> But for those without documentation, immigration enforcement and abortion restrictions “combine to prevent them from traveling out of state to a provider.”

		<h3> Navigating a Post-Roe landscape
			<p> As abortion access becomes increasingly limited, many people face the costs of traveling for abortion care — and for marginalized communities, the costs are much greater. <br>
Efforts made by protective states offer some relief in this sense, but are likely not sustainable, as they largely rely on abortion funds, individual providers and clinic staff, as well as other support networks. </br>
The fight for reproductive rights is not a lost cause, however — and just like in all matters of politics, the fight begins with the vote, according to Gadarian. <br>
“While people may say that they’re pro-abortion rights, it’s a different question as to whether or not they show up and vote on that,” Gadarian said. “And in all of the states where there have been constitutional amendments to codify abortion rights, even places that are quite conservative, like Kentucky and Ohio, we have seen abortions rights be a winner on the ballot, even among people who are themselves not necessarily going to vote for Democrats.” </br>
